Brittany Woods is an automater of the things based in Central Missouri. One of Brittany's main goals is to make technology less manual to allow teams to focus on more valuable endeavors with their time. Brittany is a major proponent for DevOps and allowing tech teams to achieve harmony and increase innovation and velocity. Brittany also enjoys architecting systems, building processes, and teaching others.

When she's not automating the things, Brittany enjoys the casual binge watch on your favorite streaming service, lazy weekends, clarinet and bass guitar playing, and home improvement projects. Just don't ask her if those projects are done. 

Brittany is currently an Automation Engineer with CARFAX.
